#Frontend:
For the frontend, I have employed React, leveraging its component-based architecture to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. This allows for seamless navigation and an intuitive user experience.

#Backend:
The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, providing a robust and scalable server-side solution. This setup ensures efficient handling of API requests, user authentication, and database interactions.

#Payment Integration:
A key feature of the application is the integration of Razorpay for payment processing. This integration facilitates secure and smooth transactions, enhancing the overall user experience by enabling reliable payment methods.

#Features:
User Management: Secure user authentication and profile management.
Product Listings: Dynamic display of food items with categories and detailed descriptions.
Cart Functionality: Users can add items to the cart, manage quantities, and proceed to checkout.
Order Processing: Real-time order tracking and history.
Payment Gateway: Seamless integration with Razorpay for secure payments.
This project showcases the integration of various modern web technologies to create a full-fledged application that is both scalable and maintainable. I am thrilled to have implemented a complete solution from frontend to backend, including payment processing, and look forward to exploring further enhancements and features.
